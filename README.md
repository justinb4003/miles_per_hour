# Miles Per Hour

This project is inspired by the Hank Green post on BlueSky found here:
https://bsky.app/profile/hankgreen.bsky.social/post/3lh3e5rp7rc2q

In it he shows a chart of "How Often people called 'Miles' Are Born In The U.S"
with data that goes up to 2019.

So, for reasons, I made a quick little app that lets you type in a name and make a similar chart with current (as of 2025-02-26) data.

It's also kind of a quick demo of how easy it is to get started with Streamlit. I think this went from idea to deployed on Streamlit.io in 30 minutes.
